                    <p>
                        <h7>We've all pitched our businesses a million times, but many women are uncomfortable standing up and bragging (showing off, talking about their strengths) in front of others. We want (and need) to get better at this! Check out Jennifer Blumberg's take on brag pitching, <a href="https://medium.com/p/253e6d7bd10a">"Why I’m glad I was forced to brag"</a>.

                    <p>
                        <h7>It's no secret that being a female founder comes with a unique set of challenges. While fundraising can be difficult for all founders, recent studies show an alarmingly higher rate or fundraising success for male founders. Why is that? Is it a confidence issue? Is it unconscious bias telling investors that women are less capable leaders? Are women less likely to sell the hyper-growth storyline that investors crave? This event was organized by General Assembly and sponsored by FEW.</h7>

                        <h7>Show Off Pitch Night is a unique way for the members of FEW to get to know each other better. We've all pitched our businesses a million times, but many women are really uncomfortable standing up and bragging (showing off, talking about their strengths) in front of others. We want (and need) to get better at this. What better way to get super vulnerable and step waaaay outside your comfort zone than with wine and good people?</h7>
